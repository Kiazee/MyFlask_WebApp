## üõ†Ô∏è Issues Encountered and Solutions

### 1. Bootstrap Styles Not Applying Properly
- **Issue**: The design did not appear as expected when the web pages were first loaded.
- **Solution**: Ensured the correct Bootstrap CDN link was included in the `<head>` tag and placed custom styles after Bootstrap to avoid being overridden.

### 2. Contact Form Not Submitting
- **Issue**: The contact form did not show any response or message after submission.
- **Solution**: Verified that the form method was set to `POST`, and implemented basic Flask form handling logic inside `@app.route('/contact', methods=['GET', 'POST'])` in `app.py`.

### 3. Inaccessible Web App from Browser
- **Issue**: The Flask server worked in the terminal but could not be accessed from the host machine.
- **Solution**: Hosted the app on all interfaces using:
  ```bash
  export FLASK_APP=app.py
  flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
